# BrainTumor
I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that accurately detects brain tumors from MRI scans. The project required creating a dataset of images optimizing the preprocessing, for network input and carefully designing the CNN architecture for binary classification. After training and validation the model achieved accuracy making it a valuable tool, for medical imaging analysis. We seamlessly integrated this model into a user Flask web application enabling time diagnostic predictions.

You can view the data in the /MRI_Data/ folder or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection) .
